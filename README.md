# TSCCA

### Introduction

In this study, we present a Tensor Sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis (TSCCA) method for identifying cancer-related miRNA-gene modules across multiple cancers. TSCCA is able to overcome the drawbacks of existing solutions and capture both the cancer-shared and specific miRNA-gene co-expressed modules with better biological interpretations. We comprehensively evaluate the performance of TSCCA using a set of simulated data and matched miRNA/gene expression data across 33 cancer types from the TCGA database.

This package is used to solve TSCCA model in our paper <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id2" id="id1">[1]</a>. 
More descriptions about these functions can be found in their annotation part.

### R code
A toy example explains how to use the TSCCA function. Before running the script, please first set the path for "script1_toy_example.R",
and then run the following R command in the Console. 

``` r
> source('script1_toy_example.R') 
```

Next, we applied TSCCA and SCCA to these simulated data in the second example. Please run the following R command in the Console.
``` r
> source('script2_simulation.R') 
```

### TCGA data 
In addition, we also comprehensively evaluated the performance of TSCCA using a set of the matched miRNA/gene expression data across 33 cancer types from the TCGA database (please see the folder "Results_tcga"). All datasets used in this paper are available at [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/14053408)
